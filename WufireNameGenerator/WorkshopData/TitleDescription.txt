New names for residential, industrial, office, and commercial buildings. Add your own names in the mods folder!
Many default names provided by reddit user /u/TPangolin

[h1]Name file location[/h1]
Windows ->
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Mods\WufireNameGenerator\

Mac ->
/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines/Addons/Mods/WufireNameGenerator/

If you have trouble finding the Library folder do the following:
Open Finder and click "Go" on the top bar. Press the Option/Alt key on your keyboard and Library will appear in that list. Then the rest of the path should be easy to find (I hope!)

Linux ->
~/.local/share/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines/Addons/Mods/WufireNameGenerator

[h1]Detailed instructions[/h1]
First activate the mod from the content manager, then start/load a city.
The first time the mod is loaded, the default names files are written to the mod location above.
These files will be used for name parts whenever a city is loaded.

The file format is JSON, which you can verify is correct at http://jsonlint.com/

[h1]Name Generation Details[/h1]
* A name is generated by pulling a random name from a list of words.
* If multiple lists are provided, the generator will add one word from each list in order.
  * If a list is marked 'optional', it has a 50% chance of being added.
  * If adding the word will be larger than the maximum name limit (32 characters), the word is ignored.
